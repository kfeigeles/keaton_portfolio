        <h1>Tell Me What You Really Think</h1>

        <h2>Although not overtly political the term “power” lends itself to control over something or someone, <br/> but
            how does one define power and what would you go if you had it?
        </h2>
        <div class="instructionsets">
            <p>Placed in Washington Square Park, a highly trafficked public space in NYC, Tell Me What You Really Think <br/>                featured
                a board that engaged passersby to anonymously fill in the blank to the question, <br/> “If I were in power
                for a day I would _______.” <br/> Responses, ranging from improving the environment to taking corporate money
                out of politics, <br/> garnered responses representative of a coastal, American liberal democracy.
            </p>
            <p>Washington Square Park was chosen for this installation because my team members and I knew we wanted a large
                open public space <br/> that was not only used as a transit hub but a space where people sat, relaxed and
                spent time. <br/> As well as that we wanted a space where there was a large range in the types of people
                <br/> who went there and we found that Washington Square Park met all of those requirements.

            <p>Iteration 1 <br> In the first iteration of this work a 24x36 board was constructed and placed on an easel.
                <br> We took this trial as a way to test not only our idea but a way to test how the placement of our <br>                piece
                was related to the amount of interaction it received. <br> For this run I was responsible for the facilitation
                of interactions, <br> I was tasked to be the “face” of our project by directly asking the park goers if they
                wanted to contribute an idea to the board.</p>

            <p>Iteration 2 <br> Taking what we learned in the first trial we moved onto the second iteration. <br> We were
                able to pinpoint a location quickly and set up. <br> We decided to create a larger board to provide more
                space for public the write their ideas. <br> Instead of having someone as the intermediary between the project
                and the public we left <br> a sharpie tied to the board and walked away leaving the board in the park on
                its own. <br> Although this left us with some fears about it blowing away and people stealing it/parts of
                it <br> we felt that not having someone watching you as you wrote may spark more of a willingness to write.</p>

            <p>After the completion of Tell Me What You Really Think I have gained an immense amount of knowledge about public
                art <br> and how art in a communal space becomes less and less about what the maker thought it would be and
                <br> more about what the community makes of it. Through the first and second iterations of this work <br>                I
                saw how anonymity played a huge factor in willingness to participate and when I was able to step away <br>                from
                the work and leave the physical piece on its own the public flocked to it and created an artwork of their
                own.</p>
