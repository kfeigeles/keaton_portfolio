        Friedman, Vanessa. "Is the Fashion Wearables Love Affair Over?" New York Times. January 12, 2018. Accessed September 09, 2018. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/fashion/ces-wearables-fashion-technology.html.<br>
        Article is about what’s next for fashion and technology - besides watches. High fashion is more concerned with design and aesthetics and may be less comfortable with using technology if it is not serving their design well. “The problem is still that, a few smart sportswear items aside, no one is really sure exactly what role technology should play in the rest of our wardrobe. What do we want our clothes to do, beyond what they already do?” This article was helpful in seeing how the fashion world may see the technology world and how although in theory the intersection is easy it is more complicated than just throwing some sensors on a t-shirt. To understand how these two fields can intersect we have to understand the motivations of each.

        The author investigates the importance of wearability in wearable technology. She argues that technology should be included in the production of the garments (weaved into the fabric, etc.) and not added later on since it disrupts the comfort of the user thus affecting its functionality and decreases the aesthetic appeal of the garment.

        Article talks about wearable technology as a benefit to society and something that can hinder it. The author talks about how he isn’t good at multitasking and how having everything you need to do your work on your person could help with this because you do not need to think as much about the things you need for your work and can access things faster. Having all of this access is a good thing but also can provide an obscene number of distractions if you are walking around with glasses that give you access to the internet legitimately on your face.

        This article expands on the importance of aesthetics in wearable technologies with a more personal twist. They take special consideration on the user and their needs/tastes. They argue that wearable technology is not successful and will no be marketable if it doesn’t adapt and accommodate to its user.

        Author writes about apple buying a startup that is focused on AR glasses. As well at tech the company wants to create glasses that are actually visually appealing and that the user would want to wear. The article talks about how the glasses are thin and lightweight and carry a similar aesthetic to normal glasses - this may make an easier transition to wearing them since they are a familiar feeling to the wearer if they have ever worn glasses/sunglasses. In this case the aesthetics are important to the creator as well as creating functional technology. There is a clear understanding that the buyer is interested in having a cool piece of technology but will not want to walk around with giant bulky glasses on their face that will be more distracting than useful. 
        “Producing crystal clear optical displays thin and light enough to fit into glasses similar to everyday frames with images bright enough for outdoor use and suited to mass manufacturing at a relatively low price.”

        Focusing on wearable technology from a luxury market point of view, the article touches upon market research and the future of fashion products with technology. The author believes that the future of technology and fashion lies in garments and the importance of collaboration between brands. Furthermore, it brings out the arguments whether repurposing everyday objects will confuse the public and create issues in the selling and advertising aspects.

        Statt, Nick. "Google and Levi’s First Smart Jacket Is a Wash." The Verge. October 06, 2017. Accessed September 09, 2018. https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16428338/google-atap-levis-project-jacquard-denim-smart-jacket-review.<br>
        Levi x Apple jacket collaboration was not successful - although it looked good and was aesthetically appealing the technology did not work well enough for people to want to use it. This is an example of how, for a wearable technology garment to be successful it needs to be equally wearable and technologically sound. In this case the aesthetic value overpowered the technological development and created flaws that ultimately squashed the entire project.
