    <h1>How Do You Wear That?</h1>

    <h2>Technology is integrated into every aspect of our lives, from smart watches to<br>smart homes,we are forever tied
        to the internet of things.<br>Whats next? Could fashion be the final frontier?</h2>

    <div class="IiF">
        <div class="IiF-text-1">Designers Lizette Ayala and Jo Biscailuz and I began a collaboration research project on wearable
            technology<br>and how the usability and aesthetics of it influence societies feelings about it and the overall usage of
            a specific<br>wearable tech piece. As the project progressed we each moved in our own directions to create three
            unique<br>explorations of wearable technology. For these explorations I chose to focus on the question: What constitutes
            wearable?
        </div>
        <div class="IiF-text-2">Research<br>Our research is to explore the intersectionality between aesthetics and functionality within wearable technology.<br>Can they go hand in hand? Are they in competition with one another? Lastly, how fluidly could these machines function in an environment?<br>

        <div class="IiF-text-3">2D Exploration<br>In honor of street style and fashion week I chose to experiment the idea
            of legitimately wearing various<br>technical components by taking various photos of bloggers from fashion week
            and photoshopping chipboard pieces on<br>top of one element of their outfits. Street style has become an iconic
            part of fashion week and a time for<br>experimentation in fashion, if wearables could survive here they can make
            it anywhere.<br><div class="IiF-2D-image"><img src="2D_IiF.jpg"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="IiF-text-4">3D Exploration<br>In my next exploration I chose to look more into the idea of what technically
            is wearable.<br>We normally associate wearable with things that we have to physically wear like a shoe, watch,<br>or
            shirt. I took this opportunity to challenge that idea by framing a wearable as something that we<br>would constantly
            have with us but we do not necessarily have to wear. My 3D iteration was a<br>keychain that would serve as a
            key for the user after they scanned their fingerprint into it.<br>As someone who is constantly locking themselves
            out of their apartment I felt that creating something<br>you can attach to your bag or wallet could help eliminate
            this problem. I chose to 3D print a<br>prototype of this keychain to properly show a scaled up version of not
            only the<br> fingerprint but the shape and overall feeling of this piece.<br><div class="IiF-3D-image"><img src="3D_IiF.jpg"></div></div>
        <div class="IiF-text-5">Interactive Exploration<br>My final dive into wearable technology was a piece rooted in interaction.
            I created a<br>prototype of a necklace that incorporated a temperature sensor to keep track of the wears core<br>temperature
            and if it were to rise or drop the necklace would then emit cooling or heating<br>pulses to correct it. Again
            I chose to 3D print the physical pendant for the necklace and then created<br>Illustrator files that show how
            the interaction would work.<br></div>

        <div class="IiF-necklace"><img src="necklace_interactionstudycopy.jpg"></div>
            <div class="IiF-text-6">Through not only research but through multiple rounds of ideation and prototyping this project
            helped<br>me gain insight on the world of wearable technology and pushed me to go through multiple<br>rounds of experimentation
            within the same theme. I was able to push myself to create three projects<br>that reflected wearable technology
            in three different ways. I learned that integrating technology into<br>fashion is not as simple as throwing a step
            counter in a sneaker and to truly integrate<br>technology and fashion the designer has to consider both the usability
            and aesthetic value of what they<br>are creating - not discount one to serve the other.</div>
