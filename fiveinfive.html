    <h1>Ease Dropped</h1>

    <h2>You think you have #firstworldproblems? These New Yorkers are full of them.</h2>

    <div class="five">
        <p>For five days I took out my headphones and actually started paying attention to what the people around me said.<br>            Doing
            this forced me to get out of my head and listen to what the people around me actually talked about.<br>Inspired
            by the Instagram account @OverheardNewYork I wanted to use the cities inhabitants as my muse<br>to create five
            different art pieces that they unknowingly dictated to me.</p>
        <p>In my deep dive into ease dropping I gave myself two rules to follow<br>1. Listen to a strangers conversation<br>2.
            Take one quote from that conversation and do a one minute sketch of it</p>

                <p>Day 1<br><div class="day-1-image"><img src="day1_5x5.jpg"></div><br>“… and her makeup was fucked.”<br>“Who?”<br>“Nancy.”<br>“Nancy as in Nancy’s funeral Nancy?”<br>"Yeah.”

            <div class="day-2">
                <p>Day 2<br><div class="day-2-image"><img src="day2_5x5.jpg"></div><br>“Well I turned on the water and it was brown so thats fun.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="day-3">
                <p>Day 3<br><div class="day-3-image"><img src="day3_5x5.jpg"></div><br>“I was so hungover.”<br>“Did you get some Gatorade or something?”<br>“No, I just downed two bottles
                    of wine on my couch.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="day-4">
                <p>Day 4<br><div class="day-4-image"><img src="day4_5x5.jpg"></div><br>“I can’t believe they’re 50 cents now!”<br>“Right, like the 35 cents was to much … bananas are
                    not a right anymore!”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="day-5">
                <p>Day 5<br><div class="day-5-image"><img src="day5_5x5.jpg"></div><br>“… bro, when I got home he had used the last Q-Tip and didn’t even get new Q-tips … what am I
                    supposed to do with dirty ear canals.”</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>After the completion of this project I found myself paying more attention to what I said when I was on the<br>phone
            in public and talking to my friends in places like coffee shops and restaurants. I had spent a week<br>listening
            to strangers which made me more conscious of that fact that those strangers could just as easily have been<br>listening
            to me. I always felt a sense of privacy within public spaces in New York because everyone has their own agenda<br>
            and couldn’t care less about me or what I’m doing but after this project I am more aware that this might not
            always be true. </p>
