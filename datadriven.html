    <h2>Let's get ... AVO CONTROL</h2>

    <div class="avocad-oh">
        <div class="avo-intro">Who doesnâ€™t love an avocado? I created a data-driven webpage based on a google survey I created
            by turning the submitted answers into a spreadsheet and creating an API. Through this API I was able to track
            the answers and show them as a list on my webpage.</div>
        <!-- <div class="avo-images">

            <img src="avo_photo2.png">
        </div> -->
        <div class="avo-link">
            <a href="https://kfeigeles.github.io/systemsfall2018/datadriven_webpage/index.html">CLICK ME!<br>DO IT FOR THE AVOS!</a>
        </div>
        <div class="avo-conclusion">By creating this webpage I was able to dive into API creation, which is something I had
            never done before. I gained very valuable knowledge about this topic and got to make some cute avocado animations
            along the way.</div>
