    <h1>The VIS</h1>

    <h2>ID free … Easy as 1, 2, 3</h2>

    <div class="the-vis">
        <div class="introduction">In this project I explored biometric authentication and how it is implemented<br>in society
            and how it can be further developed for future use.
        </div>
        <div class="research-ideation">Through my research into this topic I discovered how willing society is to not only
            accept but implement biometric authentication<br>into their lives. From touch and face ID on cell phones to global
            entry fingerprint and iris scanning the world overall is moving towards<br>an ID free lifestyle. Along with furthering
            my knowledge in current use cases for biometric authentication my research assisted my<br>further understanding
            of how this technology will most likely be used and developed for the future.<br><br>I discovered a project in
            development where biometric authentication will serve as a verification step when sending data over<br>unsecured
            networks. In this case when banking online and sending legal documents the sender would have to verify their
            identity<br>and then the person on the receiving end would also need to verify their ID before being able to
            open any sensitive document.
            <br><br>Another use case I discovered was the slow implementation of biometrics into the airport check in process.
            In Atlanta and Denver<br>a fingerprint scanner has been rolled out for boarding/check-in to prevent people with
            false passports from bypassing security<br>due to human error and to reduce fraud overall. This technology is
            already used for the global entry program (international travel)<br>but has only recently been introduced for
            traveling within the United States.

        <div class="systems-map">To help my understanding of this topic I created a systems map that connections various
            aspects and uses of biometric authentication.

        <div class="product-pitch">The idea of using biometrics authentication in replacement of an ID gave lead me to question
            how else it could be implemented. This questioning lead me to develop my own biometric authentication system
            centered around voting and voter identity verification. The VIS (voter identity scanner) is an identity
            verification tool that scans the iris’s of a voter to confirm their identity instead of ID or signature verification.
            As a tool to combat future voter suppression The VIS allows citizens to enroll in the program and then can
            be scanned in at their polling location and eliminates the problem of not having a valid ID or an ID at all. When
            applied within the voting system a voter can use this technology in cases where they do no have a drivers license
            or a valid form of ID. Many people who grew up in cities or urban areas and use public transportation and
            do not have a drivers license are forced to attempt to obtain one if they want to participate in democracy
            - many are not able to obtain a license due to vision problems, and other ailments as well as not having access
            or funds to obtain one. The VIS is the solution to this - everyone has iris’s and enrolling in the system
            is free with no enrollment deadline and no enrollment fee.

        <div class="disaster-exhibit">While working on this project I challenged myself to think of the possible implications
            of this machine and how it would change how we vote and if there were any negatives that could emerge. I dreamt
            up a scenario in which the machines software glitched and shut down due to hacking by political operatives and
            the election had to be called off. The president of the U.S. at the time of this hack then proclaimed himself
            dictator and began stripping the government of its check and balance system. Eventually a resistance emerges
            and the dictator is overthrown and democracy is restored. By thinking about the negatives of what I created I
            was able to further reflect on the idea of biometric authentification and was able to gain an even deeper understanding.
            After finalizing my disaster scenario I created an exhibit based on the now defunct VIS program and machine.
            In this exhibit the visitor would look through The VIS machine as if they were to scan their iris’ but they are
            shown a scrolling 3D timeline of the events that occurred that lead to the shutdown of The VIS and the dictatorship.

        <div class="conclusion">I have always been interested in biometric authentification and I took this exploration as a way to not only further my<br>knowledge about its current uses but to challenge myself to explore the possibilities of its future.
